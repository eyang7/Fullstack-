                <h3> Character information, arc, and backstory </h3>
                    <h4> Biography </h4>
                        <p> Michael Gary Scott was born on March 15, 1965[9] in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be "two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.
                            In the episode "Take Your Daughter to Work Day", Michael makes the claim that he was a child star on a kids' show called Fundle Bundle; however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of many guest children. In the old recording being played, he speaks touchingly about what he wanted when he grew up: get married, have "100 kids" so he could then have "100 friends" and none of them could say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost all his tuition money in a pyramid scheme.</p>
                    <h4> Interests </h4>
                        <p> Michael's catchphrase is "That's what she said!", which he uses whenever someone, intentionally or not, makes a sexually suggestive double entendre, including business meetings and legal depositions. Michael finds uttering the phrase so irresistible that in "Sexual Harassment", he is goaded by Jim into saying it just seconds after Jan Levinson and a lawyer from Corporate specifically asked him to stop. </p>
                    <h4> Personality and management style </h4>
                        <p> Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills, management or otherwise. Jim Halpert once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time: 80% distracting others; 19% procrastination; and 1% critical thinking. Jim added that he inflated the "critical thinking" percentage so people could actually see it on the graph. His laid-back approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity, particularly when Michael places personal interests as a priority over work (such as his birthday, someone else's birthday, or his various seminars). To avoid being disciplined for his foolish actions, Michael often resorts to scapegoating employees to cover himself. Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees, Michael believes that Scranton is "the cool, fun branch... like Animal House". He is genuinely upset when the top salesman from the Utica office trashes Scranton in a phone call by saying it's "worse than Camden". </p>

            <div id = "comparison with UK version"> 
                <h3> Comparison with David Brent </h3>
                    <p> Although originally based on David Brent, Scott developed into a significantly different character than his British counterpart. Whereas Brent is shown to be irredeemably incompetent, Scott is portrayed as an outstanding salesman who is unwisely promoted to a management role to which he appears completely ill-suited. (In a scathing performance review during episode eight of season two, Jan Levinson suggests that Scott should be removed from his management role and return to sales.) Scott is thus an apt example of the Peter Principle which states that competent persons in a hierarchical organization will "rise to the level of their incompetence" after which they will not advance. </p>

                <h3> Behind the scenes </h3>
                    <p>U.S. Developer Greg Daniels envisioned Michael Scott behaving as if "I was hoping that the documentary about this would one day be seen by Jennifer Aniston, and I was just trying to impress her any way I possibly could."[15] On the audio commentary for "Valentine's Day", Daniels notes that he included a meeting between Michael and two other branch managers in order to contrast Michael's level of competence with theirs: while Michael is not as dynamic as Josh Porter who would later be hired in a senior management position at Staples, his management skills are superior to those of the hopelessly inept Craig and could be regarded as an adequate but unexceptional branch manager who is, despite his antics, just competent enough to avoid being fired. </p>
